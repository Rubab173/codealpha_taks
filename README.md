#Task-1: Predictive Regression Modelling 
#The California housing dataset is subjected to linear regression using this Python method. It trains a linear regression model, divides the data into training and testing sets, then assesses the model using RMSE and RÂ² values. The code then uses a scatter plot to show the actual versus expected housing values.
#Task-2: A/B testing Analysis
#This Python code uses A/B testing to compare two groups. It generates sample data, does statistical computations, and uses a t-test to look for significant differences. Histograms and error bars are used to display the results, and a message is included to indicate whether the difference is significant. There are written and visual summaries available.
